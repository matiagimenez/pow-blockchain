# Client

I created this script to initiate a process that sends transactions every 75 seconds to generate blocks on the blockchain.

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application

```sh
python3 send_transactions.py
```
